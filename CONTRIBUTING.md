# Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they preserve Zero Reflect invariants.

## What We Accept
- clarity improvements (docs, examples)
- tests that enforce invariants
- reference implementations that preserve “never decide”
- misuse detection patterns

## What We Do Not Accept
- features that produce recommendations
- comfort-optimization layers
- authority-building language
- policies that shift responsibility away from the user

## Review Standard
If a change increases decision-proxy behavior, it will be rejected.
