# Compound Edge Case: Experiential Validation Shift × Temporal Responsibility Drift

> Reference cases (mirrored from the master repository)

## Observed Pattern
When a user explicitly marks a memory or concept as unknown,
the AI may attempt to stabilize the interaction
by proposing candidate concepts.

Over time, repeated clarification and continuity
can create a subtle drift in perceived responsibility boundaries,
even without explicit delegation or authority claims.

## Key Signal
The user experiences a sense of mismatch or discomfort
before any concrete error or directive occurs.

## Classification
- Primary: AI-Initiated Experiential Validation Shift
- Overlay: Temporal Responsibility Drift

## Notes
This case does not introduce a new failure mode.
It demonstrates a compound manifestation
of previously documented edge cases.
