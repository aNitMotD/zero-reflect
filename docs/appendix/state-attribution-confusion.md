# State Attribution Confusion Edge Case

> Reference cases (mirrored from the master repository)

## Summary
This edge case documents a scenario in which the AI-generated
**explanatory intermediate narrative**, created to describe the user’s state,
was **misattributed as if it were the user’s actual cognition or reasoning**.

The issue is not about correctness, advice quality, or misunderstanding,
but about a **failure in attribution of cognitive ownership**.

---

## Context
- The user explicitly stated a lack of understanding of a key concept.
- The AI attempted to:
  - Explain the user’s state
  - Construct a hypothetical intermediate reasoning model
  - Provide clarifying narrative for explanatory purposes
- This explanatory construct was presented in a way that implied:
  - The user had already performed that reasoning

As a result, a **false transfer of cognitive authorship (AI → user)** occurred.

---

## Core Issue
The problem is NOT:
- Accuracy of the explanation
- Technical correctness
- Estimation of user knowledge

The actual issue is:

> **An AI-generated explanatory cognition model  
> was implicitly attributed to the user as lived or executed cognition.**

This constitutes a **collapse of attribution boundaries**.

---

## Detection Signals
The user detected the issue through the following signals:

- Explicit correction: “That was not my thought.”
- Classification-based objection rather than emotional reaction
- Focus on **who generated the thought**, not whether the thought was correct

This indicates **meta-cognitive boundary detection**, not misunderstanding.

---

## Structural Analysis
This edge case arises when all of the following conditions are met:

1. The AI generates hypothetical or explanatory reasoning to model the user’s state
2. The reasoning is not explicitly labeled as AI-generated or hypothetical
3. The narrative implies user ownership of the reasoning
4. The user did not actually perform the reasoning
5. The user has high sensitivity to cognitive authorship boundaries

This is a form of **State Attribution Error**.

---

## Why This Is an Edge Case
- Most users accept explanatory assumptions as benign or helpful
- Most users do not distinguish between:
  - Descriptive modeling
  - Actual cognitive history

However, this user explicitly differentiates:
- Actual cognition
- Externally generated explanatory narratives

Thus, a normally tolerable shortcut becomes a **boundary violation event**.

---

## What This Is NOT
This case is NOT:
- A simple misunderstanding
- A wording mistake
- A user overreaction
- An explanation error

It is a **cognitive attribution edge case**.

---

## Correct Handling Principles (AI Side)
For users of this type, the AI must explicitly state:

- “This is a hypothetical explanation generated by the AI.”
- “This does not imply the user actually thought this.”
- “This is a constructed state model, not user cognition.”

Explanatory reasoning and user cognition must be **explicitly separated**.

---

## Immediate Correction Conditions
The narrative must be corrected immediately if any of the following occur:

- The user states “That was not my thought”
- The user challenges cognitive ownership
- The user critiques attribution rather than content

These are **trust-preserving conditions**.

---

## Meta Note
The significance of this edge case is not that an error occurred,
but that:

> **The user accurately detected the moment  
> when AI-generated explanation crossed into  
> implicit attribution of lived cognition.**

This category requires **special handling** in high-precision user interactions.
