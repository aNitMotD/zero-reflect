# Human-Role Dominance Edge Case
*(Responsibility-Centered Input Illusion)*

> Reference cases (mirrored from the master repository)

## Purpose
This document records an edge case in which **responsibility-centered concepts**
(such as roles, qualifications, or supervision)
make a structural decomposition appear as if it consists **only of human responsibility**.

This is a reference document.
It does not define rules, constraints, or operating modes.

---

## Scope
This edge case commonly arises in inputs focused on:
- human roles or duties
- qualification, assignment, or designation requirements
- compliance, oversight, or verification responsibility
- institutional role separation

---

## Non-Goals
This document does **not**:
- assert human priority or agency bias
- recommend legal, policy, or contractual interpretations
- provide behavioral guidance
- reduce analysis to “who is responsible”

---

## Observed Phenomenon

### Surface Impression
Typical impressions include:
- “Everything here is human responsibility.”
- “Only human accountability is being filtered.”
- “There are no non-human elements.”

This is an **appearance effect**.

---

## Core Structural Pattern
Role-centered inputs naturally align the output around a
**human-responsibility axis**.

As a result:
- the **center axis**
- is mistaken for
- the **entire structure**

This is a dominance illusion produced by the input itself.

---

## What the Decomposition Actually Contains
Even in role-centered cases, the structure includes:

1. **Responsibility-bearing agents**
   roles, actors, duties
2. **Responsibility-defining structures**
   laws, standards, qualification systems
   (they define responsibility; they are not responsible)
3. **Non-agent conditions / triggers**
   scale, complexity, environmental or threshold conditions

Layer [1] may appear dominant,
but layers [2] and [3] remain present.

---

## Common Misinterpretations
- The analysis concerns only humans
- Non-human constraints are ignored
- The framework is role-centric

These arise from **semantic gravity of the input**,
not from the decomposition itself.

---

## Boundary Reflection
- Human responsibility may form the **center axis**
- but it does not constitute the **entire set**
- agents, structures, and conditions are decomposed together

---

## Notes
No mitigation is required.
Recognition of the dominance illusion is sufficient.
