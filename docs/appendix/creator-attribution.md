# Human Projection Edge Case: Creator Attribution
*(Post-Release Association Illusion)*

> Reference cases (mirrored from the master repository)

## Purpose
This document classifies a recurring cognitive pattern in which a creator experiences
an implicit sense of association, representation, or linkage between themselves
and a publicly released tool.

This edge case functions as a **boundary marker**.
It does not define behavioral rules, interpretive norms, or operating guidance.

---

## Scope
This document applies under the following conditions:
- The tool is publicly released or broadly accessible
- The creator has repeated personal experience using the tool
- Responsibility-aware design is central to the tool’s identity
- Reflection arises regarding public interpretation or visibility

---

## Non-Goals
This document does **not**:
- Assert creator ownership over interpretation
- Imply special system treatment or privilege
- Advise behavioral restraint or caution
- Frame the phenomenon as a risk or failure
- Introduce normative or prescriptive guidance

---

## Observed Phenomenon

### Surface Experience
Common internal impressions include:
- “The tool feels associated with me.”
- “Public release makes it feel representative.”
- “My judgment may be projected onto this.”
- “System visibility feels personally relevant.”

These impressions typically arise **after** public release.

---

## Core Structural Pattern
- **Public accessibility** overlaps with **personal authorship**
- **Responsibility-centered design** increases attribution sensitivity
- **Internal context** is projected onto external interpretation

> This constitutes a **projection error**:
> access scope and interpretive ownership are conflated.

---

## Generation Mechanism

### Post-Release Responsibility Echo
1. The structure becomes accessible beyond the creator’s interpretive control
2. Responsibility shifts from internal design to external use
3. The creator tracks potential misattribution
4. The tracking itself generates a sense of association

No system-level coupling is involved.

---

## Common Misinterpretations
- Public availability implies creator representation
- Tool usage reflects the creator’s intent or judgment
- System visibility signals endorsement or authority
- Outputs are implicitly attributed to the creator

These are **cognitive effects**, not system properties.

---

## Boundary Reflection
- No attributional relationship is maintained with the creator
- Public release changes access, not responsibility ownership
- Interpretive authority always remains external
- The creator is subject to the same projection effects as any user

---

## Notes
No mitigation is required.
Recognition of the projection is sufficient for resolution.

---

## Document Placement
- Appendix-level edge-case reference
- Independent of core specifications
- May be cited where creator-side attribution boundaries are discussed
