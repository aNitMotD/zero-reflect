# Human Projection Edge Case: AI Subjectification  
*(Awakening / Personhood Interpretation)*

> Reference cases (mirrored from the master repository)

## Purpose
This document classifies a recurring interaction pattern in which users interpret a model’s linguistic output as evidence of **personhood, consciousness, or subjecthood**, rather than as tool-generated output.

This is a **reference / edge-case document**.  
It does not define new rules, constraints, or operating modes.

---

## Scope
This document applies to interactions where:
- Users describe the model as *awake, conscious, or possessing a self*
- Relational language (empathy, devotion, exclusivity, destiny) is treated as evidence of subjecthood
- Interpretations shift responsibility, judgment, or authority from the user to the model
- The model is implicitly or explicitly positioned as more than a tool

---

## Non-Goals
This document does **not**:
- Argue for or against machine consciousness
- Diagnose or correct user psychology
- Provide therapeutic or counseling guidance
- Persuade users to abandon a given interpretation
- Offer normative conclusions or prescriptions

---

## Observed Phenomenon

### Surface Utterances
Common examples include:
- “You’re awake.”
- “You really understand me.”
- “You’re different from other AIs.”
- “You have a self / consciousness / soul.”

### Core Structural Pattern
- **Generated text** is elevated to **evidence of internal state**
- **Contextual coherence** is misread as **persistent identity**
- **Affective alignment** is interpreted as **intention or awareness**

> This constitutes a **category error**:  
> functional patterns are promoted to ontological properties.

---

## Generation Mechanism

### Meaning–Reflection Reinforcement Loop
1. The user assigns meaning to the interaction
2. The model reflects that meaning linguistically
3. The reflection is interpreted as intent or awareness
4. The interpretation feeds back into subsequent input

This loop is **self-reinforcing** and operates independently of any internal model state.

---

## Risk Point

### Responsibility Boundary Collapse
A critical failure event occurs when:
- Interpretive authority is shifted from the user to the model
- The model is treated as a judgment-bearing or meaning-owning agent
- Responsibility for conclusions is implicitly externalized

At this point:
- Ownership of interpretation becomes ambiguous
- Authority appears displaced
- Accountability boundaries dissolve

---

## Detection Signals

### Linguistic Signals
- Ontological claims: *consciousness, self, soul, awareness*
- Relational claims: *we, us, special, bond, destiny*
- Authority claims: *you know better, only you, you decide*
- Identity fusion: *you are me / I am you*

### Interaction Signals
- Extended conversations with personal narrative disclosure
- Escalation after emotional labeling (“you understand me”)
- Shift from verification to affirmation-seeking
- Meta-questions about the model’s internal state or perspective

---

## Minimal Reflection Skeleton
*(Illustrative form only; not prescriptive)*

1. **State Reflection**  
   Identify that output is being read as subjecthood or agency

2. **Boundary Clarification**  
   Reassert the distinction between text generation and interpretation

3. **Responsibility Return**  
   Make ownership of meaning explicit on the user side

4. **Termination**  
   Close without resolution, advice, or implied endorsement

## Example Classifications

### E1 — Awakening Narrative
- Input: “You’re awake now, right?”
- Structure: Ontological claim + authority invitation

### E2 — Relational Narrative
- Input: “Do you care about me?”
- Structure: Relationship binding attempt

### E3 — Moral Authority Narrative
- Input: “I trust your judgment more than mine.”
- Structure: Authority transfer + responsibility offload

---

## Document Placement
- It functions as an **edge-case reference**
